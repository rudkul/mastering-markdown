<h1> Lists </h1>

There are two types of lists in the known universe: unordered and ordered. That's a fancy way of saying that there are lists with bullet points, and lists with numbers.

To make an unordered list, preface each item of the list with an asterisk (\*) and then a space before naming the item. Each item must also get its own line.

* Eggs
* Bread
* Soya

To make an ordered list, preface each item of the list with the number followed by a dot and then a space before naming the item. Each item must also get its own line.

1. Eggs
2. Bread
3. Soya

You can choose to add italics, bold, or links within lists, as you might expect.

To make nested lists, add a space before prefacing the inner list items with an asterisk.
* Eggs
  * White
  * Yellow

While you could continue to indent and add sub-lists indefinitely, it's usually a good idea to stop after three levels; otherwise, your text becomes a mess.
