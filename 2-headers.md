<h1>Headers</h1>

You need to put hash before text to make it a header. Header 1 is larger than Header 2 and so on.
<h1>Header1</h1>
<h2>Header2</h2>
<h3>Header3</h3>
<h4>Header4</h4>
<h5>Header5</h5>
<h6>Header6</h6>

For Header 1 put 1 hash before the text that needs to be a header, 2 hashes for Header 2 and so on.

You cannot make headers **bold** but you can *italicize* them.
