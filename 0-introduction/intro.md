It is used to write content for the web. 
It is written in __plaintext__ with symbols like \` and \*.

It can easily shared between all devices and hence has become the standard for all kinds of __documentation__ across all domains.
__GitHub__ and __Reddit__ mainly use markdown to style their word content.
