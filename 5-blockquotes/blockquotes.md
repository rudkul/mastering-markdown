<h1> Blockquotes </h1>

A blockquote is a sentence or paragraph that's been specially formatted to draw attention to the reader.
>This is a Blockquote.

Blockquotes can be made by putting a \> symbol before the line. (greater-than symbol)

You can also place a caret character on each line of the quote. This is particularly useful if your quote spans multiple paragraphs. Notice that even **blank lines** must contain the caret character. This ensures that the entire blockquote is grouped together.

Block quotes can contain other Markdown elements, such as italics, images, or links.
